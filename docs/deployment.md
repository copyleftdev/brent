# Deployment

The `brent.deployment` package provides tools and utilities for managing the deployment of applications and services. This package is designed to facilitate the automation and management of deployment processes.

## Modules

The `brent.deployment` package includes the following module:

- `manager.py`: Provides functionality to deploy applications and manage deployment scripts.

## manager.py

### Overview

The `manager.py` module contains the `DeploymentManager` class, which is used to execute deployment scripts and manage deployment environments.

### DeploymentManager Class

#### Initialization

```python
DeploymentManager(deployment_script: str)
```

- `deployment_script`: The path to the deployment script that will be executed.

#### Methods

- `deploy(environment: str) -> str`
  - Executes the deployment script for the specified environment and captures its output.
  - `environment`: The target deployment environment (e.g., `staging`, `production`).
  - Returns the output of the deployment script as a string.

#### Example Usage

```python
from brent.deployment.manager import DeploymentManager

deployment_manager = DeploymentManager('/path/to/deploy.sh')
deploy_output = deployment_manager.deploy('staging')
print(f"Deployment output: {deploy_output}")
```

## Detailed Description

### DeploymentManager

The `DeploymentManager` class provides a simple interface to execute deployment scripts and manage deployment environments. This class is useful for automating deployment processes and ensuring consistent deployment procedures across different environments.

#### Initialization

To initialize a `DeploymentManager` instance, provide the path to the deployment script that you want to execute.

```python
deployment_manager = DeploymentManager('/path/to/deploy.sh')
```

#### Deploy Method

The `deploy` method executes the deployment script for the specified environment. The environment is passed as an argument to the deployment script, allowing you to customize the deployment process based on the target environment.

```python
deploy_output = deployment_manager.deploy('staging')
```

The `deploy` method captures the output of the deployment script and returns it as a string. This output can be logged or processed further as needed.

### Example Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the `DeploymentManager` class to execute a deployment script for the `staging` environment and log the output:

```python
from brent.deployment.manager import DeploymentManager
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Initialize the DeploymentManager with the path to the deployment script
deployment_manager = DeploymentManager('/path/to/deploy.sh')

# Execute the deployment script for the 'staging' environment
try:
    deploy_output = deployment_manager.deploy('staging')
    logger.info(f"Deployment output: {deploy_output}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error during deployment: {e}")
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the deployment script is executable and has the necessary permissions.
- The `deploy` method assumes that the deployment script accepts the target environment as a command-line argument. Modify the script and method as needed to fit your deployment process.
- It is recommended to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the deployment script to ensure that errors are logged and managed appropriately.
